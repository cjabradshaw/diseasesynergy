# Script 1. Rabbit_Multistate_DeadRecovery
This script is for assessing how previous disease exposure/immunity state and recurring outbreaks of myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease affect rabbit survival (S) and immunity state transitions (Psi)

# Script 2. Rabbit_Multistate_Plotting_Output
This script is for plotting the output from script 1. Run script 1 and save the output first.

Notes-

Immunity state / previous exposure categories:
N - Immunity to neither virus
M - Immunity to myxoma virus only
R - Immunity to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) only
B - Immunity to both viruses

Age groups:
Kittens â‰¤ 600 g (may have residual maternal immunity to RHD)
Adults > 600 g (unlikely to have residual maternal immunity)
